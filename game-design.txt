Ratchet App Design
==================
Rino Jose <@rjose>

We'll follow along with the Android game book and go through the
following steps:

        * Game mechanics
        * Rough back story with main characters
        * Items, power ups
        * Rough sketch of graphcis style based on backstory
        * Sketches of all screens, including transitions and triggers


Game Mechanics
--------------
There are 20 levels in this game. Each of them is a Quarter (i.e., 3
months). Each level has 2 phases. The first phase is called
"Planning". Here, you identify the work your org needs to do, break
that work up into "tracks", and figure out how many people you need.

The second phase is called "Tracking". Here, each track pulls
from the quarter plan and breaks down the work into sprints. You
need to look for hotspots across your teams and notify people when
things change. You can subscribe to things you care about, and see
what happens as soon as it happens. This is where you'll do most of
your collaboration. You'll have ping actions that inform others or
request more info.

At the end of each level, you'll see how many points you scored and
what achievements you've unlocked.

You can engage in the planning step for any level, but tracking must
proceed in order.

Users can switch views. Changing your vertical view gives you more
or less detail and more or less breadth of view. Switching
horizontally, lets you pick different roles. You can also switch
between teams.


Planning Phase
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In the first part phase, you will be presented with a list of items
that need to be done for a given team. These will move in slowly,
but then accelerate downwards. Your goal is to triage these into
"must do" for this level, "should do" for this level, and "might do"
in a different level. You triage by flinging the item towards a
target.  If you take no action, the item will go onto the "should
do" list.



Starting the Game
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You need to log in first and then pick a role.


Selecting the Level
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is where you can select which level to play next. There is only
one Tracking level active at any point, but Planning levels can be
started at any time.


Backstory
---------
Congratulations! You are Mr. Exec and have just taken on some new
responsibilities and are responsible for a  large team. The problem
is that you don't know what's going on! Fortunately, you have
a brilliant Ph.D. on your staff who's wired up all of your random
spreadsheets into a tool he calls "Ratchet" (because you can use it
to tighten up parts of your org).

Your goal is to find out which parts of your org are loose and
tighten them up.

There are other players in this game who are trying to help you. You
must work together in order to succeed.
